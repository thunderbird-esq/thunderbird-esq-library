 * Playwright Global Setup for Thunderbird-ESQ E2E Tests

 * The core setup logic (Docker, Supabase, health checks) has been moved to
 * `scripts/start-test-server.sh` to ensure it runs in the correct
 * execution context with proper permissions.
 *
 * This script now only provides logging hooks and a placeholder for any
 * future setup tasks that do not involve Docker.
