# ===================================================================
# Golden Rule: NEVER commit files with secrets or credentials.
# This file tells Git to ignore files that should not be in version control.
# ===================================================================

# Environment Variables
# The most critical section for security. Contains API keys and secrets.
# We will commit a `.env.example` file to show what variables are needed.
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.production.local
.env.test.local

# Allow the example file to be committed.
!/.env.example
!/.env.template


# Dependencies
# These are installed via `npm install` or `yarn install`.
# They take up a huge amount of space and should never be in the repo.
/node_modules


# Next.js
# Build output, cache, and exported static sites.
/.next/
/out/


# Supabase
# The Supabase CLI generates a local directory for state and secrets.
# This should NEVER be committed.
/.supabase


# Logs
# Log files can contain sensitive information and are specific to a single session.
logs

yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
pnpm-debug.log*


# Test & Coverage Reports

# Editor Directories and Files
# Personal editor settings. Optional, but good practice to ignore
# to prevent conflicts between different developers' setups.
/.idea

# You can UN-ignore specific vscode settings if your team agrees on them
# !/.vscode/settings.json
# !/.vscode/extensions.json
*.suo
